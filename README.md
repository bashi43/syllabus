# Machine Learning and Statistics for Physicists

Material for a [University of Illinois](http://illinois.edu) course offered by the [Physics Department](https://physics.illinois.edu).

Content is maintained on [github](https://github.com/illinois-mla) and distributed under a [BSD3 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

[Table of contents](notebooks/Contents.ipynb)

The notebooks contain exercises but you will need to enable the [exercise2 extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/exercise2) to hide the solutions while you work on them, as described in the [setup instructions](notebooks/Setup.ipynb). All solutions are visible if you view notebooks on github.

Instructors are welcome to contact dkirkby at uci.edu for access to additional material or to discuss collaboration.
